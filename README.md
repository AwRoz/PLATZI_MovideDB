# PLATZI_MovideDB
curso practico de consumo de API con JS

#Thing s to improve:
-Movies scroll section, it doesn't have a fully controlled behavior. 
    -when reloading the page, sometimes the scroll starts in a random position
    -on some devices theres no clue that there's a scroll due to the pictures fit perfectly the screen 
    
Its made with flex but apparently would be better to controll it with grid and JS.
