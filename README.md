#Thing s to improve:
-Movies scroll section, it doesn't have a fully controlled behavior. 
    -when reloading the page, sometimes the scroll starts in a random position
    -on some devices theres no clue that there's a scroll due to the pictures fit perfectly the screen 
    
Its made with flex but apparently would be better to controll it with grid and JS.


Desing:
-Designing should be tested for UI and UX before start coding. i noticed that i had to increase the size of certain elements because when tested in a phone those elements were too small, so its better to test the design from figma on a mobile device before srart coding.

-Im struggling with som styles when i want to achieve a overlap style. like the background on the movie details section, in combination to the title, description etc. apparently there's an option to use css crid to achieve the same effect instead of usinf positioning: Relative/absolute.
